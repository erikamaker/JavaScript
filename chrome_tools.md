# DEVICE MODE

- Device Mode is a feature in Chrome DevTools that allows developers to simulate different devices and screen sizes to test their web applications.
- The mobile emulation feature within Device Mode can simulate a variety of mobile devices and network conditions to give developers an accurate representation of how their app will behave on different mobile devices.
- Device Mode also allows developers to view their web application in a variety of resolutions, orientations, and pixel ratios.
- Developers can use the Network Throttling feature in Device Mode to simulate various network conditions, such as 3G or 4G connections, to test their app's performance under different network speeds.
- Device Mode also provides a number of useful tools to help developers test and debug their applications, such as the Element Inspector, Console, and Timeline.

When debugging, the workflow only applies a fix to the code that is running in your browser. It won't fix the code for all users that visit your page. To do that, you need to fix the code that's on your servers. You can, however, edit files in DevTools and save them to your sources with Workspaces.
